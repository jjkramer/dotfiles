dotfiles
===

I am a programmer.
These are my dot files.
I use vim, tmux, urxvt, and awesomewm to write c/c++, python, ruby, elixir, bash, javascript, java, scala, SQL, and lots more.

Install
=======

Simply running the install script will create softlinks for all the config files.

    ./install.sh

All files and folders begining with an underscore will be linked into the user's home directory.
